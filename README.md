## Details

Inside this repo you will find 2 folders.

# png folder

This contains the png files taken directly from the ms azure documentation. They are named as the icon code that would be returned from the ms azure maps weather api

# svg folder 

This contains close enough representations of SVG's. They are names accordingly to match the png. Close enough as not all had an exact match. 


## Thank you
https://bas.dev/about for creating the SVG files. All I did was rename them and link them to the ms azure weather api IconCodes
